// An asynchronous function returns control to your code right away while it continues to do its work. 
// This allows your code and the function to be working at the same time, asynchronously.
// When your code calls a synchronous function, the function makes your code wait until it's finished before letting the next line run (also called blocking).
// Look at the order difference of the data displayed in the console when you use node async.js and node sync.js in the terminal
